                <p>Thomas Spiese: I made this website because lots of single men don't know how to cook or where to start. This website offers a place, just for men, to learn how to cook to help them with their fitness, wallet, and health.</p>

                <p>Devon Arnone: I created this website to make cooking approachable and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of experience. Whether you're just starting your culinary journey or looking to expand your skills, this is your go-to resource for learning how to prepare delicious meals.</p>

                <p>Miguel Magana: The idea behind creating this website is to help out guys who don't know how to cook. Sometimes its just tough to figure out what to cook for the night and what better place to figure that out than this website!</p>

                <img src="Photos/IMG_1424.JPG" alt="Picture of Joshua Garay">
                <p>Joshua Garay: I created this website because I was searching for a resource like this myself. I wanted a straightforward, fun way to learn cooking techniques, plan meals, and discover recipes that suit my lifestyle. When I couldn’t find exactly what I needed, I decided to build it instead—for myself and for anyone else who’s in the same boat!</p>
